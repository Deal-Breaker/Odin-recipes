        <p>
            <ul>
            <li>1 large boneless chicken breast</li>
            <li>2 gloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup of heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 egg yolk</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 a pound of fettuccine</li>
            <li>1/2 fresh chopped parsley</li>
            <li>1 cup freshy grated Parmigian-Reggiano cheese, divided</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h4 class="bg">Steps</h4>
        <p>
            <ol>
            <li>Combine chicken breasts and chicken broth in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to low; simmer for 5 minutes. 
                Turn breasts, cover, and simmer another 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit with the cover on for 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove chicken breasts from the broth and set aside to cool, reserving the broth in the saucepan. Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, cut into bite-size slices.</li>
                <li>Return the chicken broth to medium heat and cook until reduced to 1 cup.</li>
                <li>Stir garlic, black pepper, and heavy cream into the reduced broth; bring to a simmer and remove from heat.</li>
                <li>Whisk egg yolks in a bowl until smooth. Beat 1 tablespoon of the warm cream mixture into the eggs until thoroughly incorporated; repeat until about 1/2 cup of the warm 
                    cream mixture is used.</li>
                <li>Whisk the warm cream and egg mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining cream mixture. Cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture almost 
                    comes to a simmer and thickens, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook fettuccine in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until nearly cooked through, about 7 minutes. Drain.</li>
                <li>Stir parsley, 1 cup of Parmigiano-Reggiano, and cream mixture into the pasta. Remove from heat, cover, and let sit for a few minutes until thick.</li>
                <li>Fold chicken and 1 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano into the pasta mixture to serve.</li>
                <li>Enjoy.</li>
