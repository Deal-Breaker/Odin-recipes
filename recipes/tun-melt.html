<h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Ever thought cheese and fish would go together? No? Well boy, were you wrong! Tuna melts are a wonderfully delicious food enjoyed by many (me especially) and take little to no effort
        to make! They're so good, and so simple, you may find yourself awakening at 2 AM with a serious craving for one!
        </p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (6.5 ounce) can of water packed tuna (or oil)</li>
            <li>1 can of corn</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of minced green onions</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons of mayo, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/3 cup of mozzarella cheese (or whichever cheese you prefer)</li>
            <li>salt and ground pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of butter</li>
            <li>2 slices of sourdough bread</li>
            <li>1 pinch of paprika, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine chicken breasts and chicken broth in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to low; simmer for 5 minutes. 
                Turn breasts, cover, and simmer another 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit with the cover on for 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove chicken breasts from the broth and set aside to cool, reserving the broth in the saucepan. Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, cut into bite-size slices.</li>
                <li>Return the chicken broth to medium heat and cook until reduced to 1 cup.</li>
                <li>Stir garlic, black pepper, and heavy cream into the reduced broth; bring to a simmer and remove from heat.</li>
                <li>Whisk egg yolks in a bowl until smooth. Beat 1 tablespoon of the warm cream mixture into the eggs until thoroughly incorporated; repeat until about 1/2 cup of the warm 
                    cream mixture is used.</li>
                <li>Whisk the warm cream and egg mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining cream mixture. Cook over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture almost 
                    comes to a simmer and thickens, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook fettuccine in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until nearly cooked through, about 7 minutes. Drain.</li>
                <li>Stir parsley, 1 cup of Parmigiano-Reggiano, and cream mixture into the pasta. Remove from heat, cover, and let sit for a few minutes until thick.</li>
                <li>Fold chicken and 1 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano into the pasta mixture to serve.</li>
                <li>Enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
