<h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Ever thought cheese and fish would go together? No? Well boy, were you wrong! Tuna melts are a wonderfully delicious food enjoyed by many (me especially) and take little to no effort
        to make! They're so good, and so simple, you may find yourself awakening at 2 AM with a serious craving for one!
        </p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (6.5 ounce) can of water packed tuna (or oil)</li>
            <li>1 can of corn</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of minced green onions</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons of mayo, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/3 cup of mozzarella cheese (or whichever cheese you prefer)</li>
            <li>salt and ground pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of butter</li>
            <li>2 slices of sourdough bread</li>
            <li>1 pinch of paprika, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place tuna into a mixing bowl and lightly break apart with a fork. Add green onion, corn, and mayonnaise. Pinch small pieces from mozzarella cheese into the tuna and stir to mix. Season with salt and black pepper; refrigerate tuna until needed.</li>
                <li>Heat oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
                <li>Spread butter generously on both sides of sourdough bread slices.</li>
                <li>Broil buttered bread until golden brown on top, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip bread slices and broil other side until toasted, 2 to 3 more minutes. Remove from oven and turn bread slices over on the baking sheet so the darkest sides are on the bottom.</li>
                <li>Gently spread tuna salad onto bread slices using 2 forks. Press the salad onto the bread and spread tuna all the way to the edges of the bread. Spread shredded mozzarella over each sandwich. Dust tops with paprika.</li>
                <li>Place sandwiches under broiler and cook until cheese is melted and bubbling, 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
                <li>Enjoy.</li>
        </ol>
